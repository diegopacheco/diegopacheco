### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Diego Pacheco is a seasoned, experienced software architect, author, technology mentor,  and devOps practitioner with more than 20+ years of solid experience. I've been building teams and mentoring people for more than a decade, teaching soft skills and technology daily. I've led complex architecture teams and engineering teams at scale using a variety of open-source languages like Java, Scala, Rust, Go, Python, and Groovy, cloud providers like AWS Cloud and Google GCP, amazing solutions like Akka and ActiveMQ, NoSQL databases like Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Elasticache Redis, libraries like Spring and Spring Boot and also the  NetflixOSS Stack: Simian Army, RxJava, Karyon, Dynomite, Eureka, and Ribbon, AWS KMS, S3, Containers (ECS and EKs), on Big Customers in Brazil, London, Barcelona, India, and the USA(Silicon Valley and Mid West).
